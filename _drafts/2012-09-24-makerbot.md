Much clearer in what the company's new focus is. Thanks for writing this.

You are no longer bootstrapping, hackers will move on to more open platforms that will out-innovate even as Makerbot is more successful than ever and becomes the new Stratasys.

New businesses will spring up from those smaller experimenters, the cycle will continue.

Not a terrible thing, as long as each company goes a little bit further in opening up. Makerbot went far, and had a lot of fans. The sudden change shocked the hacker community, as they thought the growth was fast and in fact leading the 3d printing world. My friend has been freelancing as a producer and his current job has a few bots churning out stuff, this is a pretty traditional advertising company and they think the quality is fine.
