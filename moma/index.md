Dear MoMA,

  Jonathan Dahan here. I discovered your job listing through the newtech
mailing list (thanks Don!) and had to apply to the Media Technology Developer
position. I've been following you very closely these past
couple of years and think we may be a perfect match. It started a few
years back when I attented the Design and the Elastic Mind exhibit. I
went once, and was overjoyed to see so many of my favorite pieces of
art (Textarc! Hektor! GRL!) already there. What was even more special
was seeing the faces of people who were never exposed to interactive
art being inquisitive. I was too excited when someone asked a question
about a piece I knew that I hopped over and had to explain what was going
on. By the end of the day I had gathered a small group of people and was
giving an impromptou tour.

  I researched the pieces that were new to me, which is one of my favorite
reasons to visit museums in general. A week later some friends asked me to
join them for a return trip, and I ended up giving two more 'tours,' mainly
just explaining HOW things worked and being surprised at what was the most
compelling aspects to those who aren't developers or artists.

  Fast forward a few years, and I was overjoyed to have the opportunity to
develop a piece with Jer Thorpe for BUG Labs during the 'Talk to Me'
exhibit. I saw the same behaviour - people being wowed by a world so
outside thier experience.

  Helping expose more and more people to art and experiences they aren't even aware
exists would be a dream job for me. Inviting discussion from all perspectives by
making accessible all forms of art. Helping a team of developers to come up with
the best ways to expose that art -  these are the things I would do as a Media
Technology Developer.

  My experience and skills are a good fit. Not just the development
environment and language chops, but the teams I build and events I participate
in - if you have any questions about the events please ask! I have at least a
few stories from each.

  Thanks for taking the time to consider me for the position.

Sincerely,

 Jonathan Dahan
