title: "jekyll, or why blogging is not the same as publishing"
---

Jekyll's workflow means I am pushing out medium quality writing faster, as
opposed to trying to perfect every post I do. This is a good and bad thing. The
good is that I am writing more, the bad is that I can and will change my posts
as my thoughts clear up (whether through introspection or discussion). Normally
changing anything outside of an tpyo edit is *bad* practice, but having a git
backend means that nothing is truly lost. What is does mean is that if people
reply to a thread, maybe there should be some jekyll-magic that shows what
revision a person replied to, just in case major changes happen. I believe all
content should be up for discussion, and there is no use separating blog posts
from static pages.
