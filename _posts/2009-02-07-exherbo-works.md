title: Exherbo works!
---

Anyone following [exherbo][] or [Bryan Ã˜stergaard's blog][blog] will have
noticed the recent trend of user-centered updates. I decided it was indication
enough to try and install exherbo this weekend. To my mild surprise, not only
did everything work, but pretty much every important piece of software (to me)
was already in the repositories - no importare or writing exheres just yet!

After writing a basic install checklist, I contacted Bryan and started writing
some documentation that will hopefully be good enough to go official. The
markdown formatted docs and other scripts are up on [github][]. I also
registered an [ohloh][] account just for fun.
