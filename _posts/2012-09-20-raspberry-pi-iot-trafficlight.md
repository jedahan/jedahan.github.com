title: Rasperry Pi Internet of Things Trafficlight
---

Hello from raspberry pi/adafruit/nycresistor!
The internet of things traffic light is being documented on [my portfoliio website](http://jonathan.is/524416) and by my partner in crime [Andrew Tergis](http://terg.is).
BTW, control the trafficlight by going to http://terg.is/tl/ and view its status on bugcommunity.com/raspberrypi/

[Twitter](http://twitter.com/jedahan) is probably the best way to get in contact with me or [him](http://twitter.com/theterg) right now.
