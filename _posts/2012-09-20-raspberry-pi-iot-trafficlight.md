Hello from raspberry pi/adafruit/nycresistor!
The internet of things traffic light is being documented on [my portfoliio website](http://jonathan.is/524416) and by my partner in crime [Andrew Tergis](http://terg.is).
BTW, control the trafficlight by going to http://terg.is/tl/ and view its status on http://bugcommunity.com/raspberrypi/

The best way to contact us is through twitter [@jedahan](http://twitter.com/jedahan) and [@theterg](http://twitter.com/theterg)
