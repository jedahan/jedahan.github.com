What ive worked on so far

  * d3.js graph to add nodes and links to visualize a mesh network
  * Finishing unit 2 of the stanford networking course
  * Built a wifi probe request sniffer with libtins, need to add some features
  * learning beaglebone PRU basics to blink an LED with Dana
    * which will eventually help me sniff an NES to identify cartridges
    Inspired by [Ambers post](http://subsymbol.org/journal/hacker-school-monday-august-4th-2014.html), I will revisit this asap. Time to figure out if there is a magic header I can look for when starting the NES, and if I can checksum the LSB of the data line to consistently identify cartridges.
