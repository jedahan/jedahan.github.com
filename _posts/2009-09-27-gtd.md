title: getting things done
---

If you are the type of person who likes systems design and optimization, you may
have a tendency to overanalyze and overcomplicate things. At least in the realm
of GTD, the simpler your system, the more you will get done. A single todo list,
devoid of symbols or colored pens representing priorities or even timelines has
served me very well lately. Every time I find myself with a few minutes to
spare, I spend time working on projects instead of working on stuff that is
meta-project (a.k.a. procrastinating). By the way, I consider blogging a project
;), not procrastination.

This is just a small example of a reoccurring theme I am noticing more and more
in other projects, for example in Exherbo. It's the theme of self-organization
from chaos. The less rules there are, the easier it is for people with similar
goals to work together. The less strict those rules, that is when they are
guidelines, and not absolute rules, the easier those guidelines are to enforce.
