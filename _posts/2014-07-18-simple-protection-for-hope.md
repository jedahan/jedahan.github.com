title: How to protect your computer at a hacker conference in 30 minutes or less
---

[HOPE X](x.hope.net) is in 8 hours, and I want to protect my laptop without installing a fresh OS.
I want to take reasonable precautions that still let me get to bed in the next 30 minutes.

  * Install Little Snitch, and whitelist ports 80, 443, 6697
  * Remove all saved wireless access points
  * Disable all network devices except usb tether to phone
  * Uninstall flash (or never install it in the first place)
  * Tape over camera
  * Disable bluetooth
  * Use a password manager instead of typing in passwords manually
  * Never share a usb port
  * Disable all network services
