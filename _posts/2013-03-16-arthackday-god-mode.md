title: ArtHackDay.net GOD MODE
---

I participated in [ArtHackDay: God Mode][]. The four projects I helped work on were

### [Messenger of God](http://arthackday.net/god_mode/57/)

  Wherein your cell phone automagically connected to our rogue network, and recieved text messages from 'god'. If you walked up to our terminal, you could send messages from a website, as god.

### [Iconoclashes](http://iconoclashes.com)

  Wherein a photoshop script built by Erik and Clement mashed up artwork pulled from my [unofficial metropolitan museum api](http://scrAPI.org). Beautiful work.

### [Twetr](http://arthackday.net/god_mode/65/)

  Wherein we provided an official unofficial app that had some very interesting backdoors...

### [Hand of God](http://arthackday.net/god_mode/45/)

   Wherein [a video](https://vine.co/v/bXDIriYizLE) may explain better than text

ArtHackDay was amazing, as always. Another one is coming up in April in Stockholm!
