* CK's BFS patches apply cleanly to the nouveau tree. No idea if the desktop is
more responsive or not.
* More and more projects are moving away from traditional version numbers, going
scm. This is good, but they should tag versions as stable more often (i'm
looking at you, [subtle][].
* Is there any way to remove ~/Desktop permanently and tell all xdg-aware apps
to use ~/ as ~/Desktop?
* OpenSSH setup on openWRT, will cover configuration in a separate post.
* Interviewed Scott Shawcroft of OSWatershed.org . Maybe an exherbo scraper
could be whipped up.
