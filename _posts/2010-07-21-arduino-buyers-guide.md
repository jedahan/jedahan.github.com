Some recommendations since they avr scene has exploded, and arduino-compatable
boards rock. I recommend supporting the manufacturer by buying direct if you
have that option.
Shield compatability is very useful when starting out. Choose one from the basic
list if you are not sure where to start, but be sure to check out the neat
features in the alternative boards too.

_$40_
* [Basic: The Freetronics TwentyTen][2010]
    * Duemilanove + mini usb connector + built in proto board
* [Alternative: Illuminato Genesis][illuminato]
    * 42 I/O pins, sweet black pcb with 10 bright white leds, 64K of code space

_$30_
* [Basic: Uno][uno]
    * The official board is more flexible, since you can change the atmel chip
* [Alternative: Seeeduino][seeed]
    * Improved form factor than the uno, but the chip is not swappable

_$20_
* [Basic: Arduino Pro][pro]
    * Smaller and cheaper, but is serial only (a serial to usb cable is ~$15)
* [Alternative: BBB][bbb]
    * $4 cheaper than the pro, and you get to build it yourself!
