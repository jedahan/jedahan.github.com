[Github][] and [Jekyll][] really have made it easier to make quick edits and
posts. It isn't really about the effort, but the perceived effort. I *feel* like
Wordpress is a heavy, slow moving piece of software even though it isn't. Being
in the console makes it fast and fun to improve on old content and write new
stuff. It is one of the reasons microblogging services took off. Now if I could
only find a way to write my resume in markdown and get output half as nice as
latex. A  resume is the perfect example of the value of separating content and
presentation.
