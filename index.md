a [hacker][me] of Computational Machinations, Digital Arts and Electronic Sounds, hailing from [Brooklyn][]

I am a programmer who likes to connect random inputs and outputs to see what people will do with them. I often take virtual streams and provide them physical facilities to exaggerate their impact on our lives. I am equally uncomfortable coding in C, C++, Rust, Javascript, Coffeescript, Python, Piet, Basic, Hypercard, and Bash. I painted a simple [echo program][] and could very easily see myself holed up for the winter just with canvas and wine.
