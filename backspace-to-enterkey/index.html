# project starts

#### [Haiku Wifi](http://jonathan.is/Haiku-Wifi): I wanted to work with a person.

* I did not care about the concept. I just wanted to work with Toby.
* What I learned that was interesting was not in the code
* What I learned is that small ideas are just a great as big ones
* What I learned is how to credit people
* Also, that the audience will always surprise (and often delight)

# project starts

#### [Messages from God](http://jonathan.is/Messenger-of-God) // [☠ Television](http://jonathan.is/radio): I wanted to work with a person / some hardware.

* We spent 99% of the time just getting the software to work.
* That was OK! The creative stuff came later!
* For the red cross, who knows that the tv wil turn into...

#### [Super Mario Clouds](http://jonathan.is/super-mario-clouds): I wanted to learn

* Cory invited people to recreate
* It would be cool to own a piece of affordable, *real* art

All of these projects, they have no fancy titles

I used to stress about that

I still do a little bit

But its OK, because I am not making art or code, just having fun learning, together

###

how i feel about software/code, living with software and hardware

how projects start for me
1. i want to work with a person. i do not care anymore on what. i just say yes.
2. i see some hardware/software, and want to learn. i do not care that it may go nowhere, that there is no art, that there is no 'creative idea' those come while spending time, digging deep. learning if some software is vast or shallow. raw and unhidden or high level and 'perfect', based in physical reality or conceptual metaverse
3. there is some great tutorial on how to make it my own

# this is apparent in the descriptions for all the 'art' on my website: this is what I did. it is X. this is how.

not some high minded art concept (though I can appreciate those!)

its just not how I work, for better or worse...
